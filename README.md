# Business Idea Generator

A monorepo containing a multi-agent AI system that generates and evaluates business ideas, featuring a **modern web application with authentication** and a CLI tool for business idea generation.

## üèóÔ∏è Monorepo Structure

This project is organized as a monorepo using npm workspaces:

```
business-idea-multi-agent/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ packages/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/          # Backend server with authentication + AI agents
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/        # Shared types and utilities
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ web/           # React web application with authentication
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/              # Documentation and reports
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json       # Root workspace configuration
```

### Packages

- **@business-idea/core**: Backend server with Fastify-based authentication system, plus AI agents and orchestration logic for business idea generation
- **@business-idea/shared**: Shared TypeScript types, interfaces, and schemas used across packages
- **@business-idea/web**: Modern React web application with authentication, session management, and user interface for the business idea generator

## üîê Authentication System

The application now features a complete authentication system:

### Test Users

For development and testing, use these pre-configured users:

| Email | Password | Role |
|-------|----------|------|
| `admin@test.com` | `Adm!nP@ss2024` | Administrator |
| `user@test.com` | `Us3r$ecure#24` | Regular User |
| `guest@test.com` | `Gu3st!Pass@24` | Guest User |

### Features

- **Session-based authentication** with secure cookie management
- **Password hashing** using bcrypt
- **CORS configuration** for frontend-backend communication
- **Protected routes** and authentication middleware
- **In-memory user store** for development (easily replaceable with database)
- **Comprehensive logging** and debug utilities

## How It Works

The system operates as a chain of specialized AI agents, orchestrated to perform a sequence of tasks:

1.  **Ideation Agent**: Receives user preferences (e.g., industry, business model) and generates a list of 10 initial business ideas. It scores each idea based on criteria like market potential and technical complexity.
2.  **Competitor Agent**: Takes the top ideas and performs a competitive analysis using Blue Ocean Strategy principles. It evaluates market saturation, identifies competitors, and calculates a Blue Ocean Score for each idea.
3.  **Business Critic Agent**: Critically evaluates ideas using web search capabilities for competitive intelligence. It performs risk assessment, validates assumptions, and calculates an Overall Score based on multiple weighted factors.
4.  **Documentation Agent**: Generates comprehensive markdown reports for the validated business ideas, including detailed analysis, insights, and recommendations.

## Ideation Agent

The Ideation Agent is responsible for generating innovative business ideas based on market trends and consumer needs. It:

### Key Features

- **Multi-Industry Focus**: Generates ideas across healthcare, education, sustainability, fintech, retail/e-commerce, and lifestyle
- **Two-Pass Generation Process**: Uses the 'o3' model to generate 10 high-quality ideas per industry, then selects the top 10 overall
- **Comprehensive Idea Details**: Each idea includes name, description, problem statement, solution, target market, and more
- **Initial Scoring**: Provides preliminary scores for disruption potential, market potential, technical complexity, and capital intensity
- **Event Streaming**: Provides real-time progress updates during the generation process

### Output Format

Each idea contains:
- Name and description
- Industry classification
- Problem solved and proposed solution
- Target market definition
- Initial viability scores (0-10 scale)

## Competitor Analysis Agent

The Competitor Analysis Agent evaluates the competitive landscape for each business idea using Blue Ocean Strategy principles. It:

### Key Features

- **Competitor Identification**: Finds and analyzes 4-6 relevant competitors for each idea
- **Market Saturation Analysis**: Evaluates how crowded the competitive space is
- **Blue Ocean Scoring**: Implements ADR-003 methodology to calculate innovation potential
- **Differentiation Factors**: Identifies unique aspects that set the idea apart from competitors
- **Event Streaming**: Provides real-time progress updates during analysis

### Blue Ocean Score Calculation

The score (0-10 scale) is based on:
- **Market Saturation** (40% weight): Lower saturation = higher score
- **Innovation Level** (35% weight): More innovative = higher score  
- **Differentiation Clarity** (25% weight): Clearer unique value = higher score

## Business Critic Agent

The Business Critic Agent is responsible for the critical evaluation and risk assessment of business ideas. It:

### Key Features

- **Critical Evaluation**: Provides skeptical analysis of each business idea, identifying potential flaws and challenges
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifies major risks (technical, market, financial, competitive, operational) that could impact success
- **Web Search Integration**: Uses the OpenAI web search tool to gather competitive intelligence and validate market assumptions
- **Overall Score Calculation**: Implements the ADR-005 methodology for comprehensive scoring

### Overall Score Methodology

The Overall Score is calculated using a two-step process:

1. **Base Score** (weighted average):
   - Disruption Potential: 20%
   - Market Potential: 25%
   - Technical Complexity (inverted): 15%
   - Capital Intensity (inverted): 15%
   - Blue Ocean Score: 25%

2. **Risk Adjustments**:
   - For each major risk identified, the score is reduced by 0.5 to 2.0 points
   - Maximum total reduction: 5.0 points

## Documentation Agent

The Documentation Agent is responsible for generating comprehensive business reports from the analyzed ideas. It:

### Key Features

- **Single-Idea Iterative Processing**: Generates detailed documentation for each idea independently (per ADR-006)
- **Comprehensive Report Generation**: Creates structured markdown reports with introduction, detailed idea sections, and summary
- **Top 3 Ideas Highlighting**: Identifies and features the top-performing ideas based on Overall Score
- **Timestamp-Based File Management**: Saves reports with timestamped filenames for versioning
- **Performance Tracking**: Logs processing time and number of ideas processed

### Report Structure

The generated reports follow this structure:

1. **Introduction**: Overview of the business idea generation process and methodology
2. **Individual Idea Sections** (10 sections): Each idea gets a detailed section including:
   - Executive Summary
   - Market Analysis
   - Technical Analysis
   - Competitive Landscape
   - Key Metrics (scores and ratings)
   - Risk Assessment
   - Implementation Roadmap
   - Funding Considerations
3. **Summary and Recommendations**: Highlights top 3 ideas with strategic insights and next steps

## Installation

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Node.js 18.x or higher
   - npm 9.x or higher
   - Git

2. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd business-idea-multi-agent
   ```

3. **Install dependencies** (this will install all workspace packages):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key
   ```

5. **Build all packages**:
   ```bash

   ```

## Usage

### üöÄ Quick Start (Recommended)

**Start the full application with authentication:**

1. **Start the backend server** (in one terminal):
   ```bash
   cd packages/core && npm run dev:server
   ```
   This starts the Fastify authentication server on `http://localhost:3001`

2. **Start the frontend** (in another terminal):
   ```bash
   cd packages/web && npm run dev
   ```
   This starts the React app on `http://localhost:5173`

3. **Access the application**:
   - Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser
   - Login with any test user (see Authentication System section above)
   - You'll be redirected to the main application after successful login

### CLI Application (Legacy Mode)

To run the original multi-agent workflow via CLI (without web interface):

```bash
cd packages/core && npm run start:cli
```

This will:
1. Generate 10 business ideas based on default preferences
2. Perform competitor analysis on each idea
3. Critically evaluate each idea with risk assessment
4. Generate a comprehensive markdown report in `docs/output/`

### Web Application (Production)

To build and run the web application for production:

```bash
# Build all packages
npm run build

# Start backend server in production
cd packages/core && npm run start:server

# Serve frontend (you'll need a static file server)
npm run build:web
```

### Command Line Options (CLI)

```bash
# Run with test cache enabled (for development)
npm run start:core -- --test-cache
```

### Development Mode with Test Cache

The test cache feature helps speed up development by caching agent outputs:

```bash
# Run with test cache enabled
npm run start:core -- --test-cache
```

When enabled, the system will:
- Cache agent outputs in `tests/cache/` directory
- Reuse cached results on subsequent runs
- Display a message: "üß™ Test cache mode enabled"

This is particularly useful during development to avoid waiting for AI responses when testing downstream agents.

## Development

### Monorepo Commands

```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm install

# Build all packages
npm run build

# Build specific package
npm run build:core
npm run build:shared
npm run build:web

# Run linting across all packages
npm run lint

# Development mode
npm run dev:web    # Start web app dev server
```

### Working with Individual Packages

Each package can be developed independently:

```bash
# Work on core package
cd packages/core
npm run build
npm run lint

# Work on web package
cd packages/web
npm run dev
npm run build
```

### Code Quality Commands

```bash
# Run linting
npm run lint

# Run type checking (builds the project)
npm run build
```

### Output

All generated reports are saved in the `docs/output/` directory with timestamped filenames:
- Format: `business-ideas-report-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md`
- Example: `business-ideas-report-20241207-084532.md`

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following:

```env
# Required for AI business idea generation
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# Optional: Backend server configuration
PORT=3001
HOST=0.0.0.0

# Optional: Session configuration
SESSION_SECRET=your-secure-session-secret-here
```

The core package will automatically load this configuration for both the authentication server and AI agents.

### Backend Server Configuration

The authentication server runs on:
- **Default URL**: `http://localhost:3001`
- **API Base**: `http://localhost:3001/api`
- **Auth endpoints**: `http://localhost:3001/api/auth/*`

Key endpoints:
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User authentication
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - User logout
- `GET /api/auth/check` - Check authentication status
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user info

### Command Line Options

- `--test-cache`: Enable test caching for development. Caches agent outputs in `tests/cache/` to speed up repeated runs.

Example:
```bash
npm run start:core -- --test-cache
```

## Architecture

The project follows a modular monorepo architecture:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Core business logic is separated from UI and shared utilities
- **Type Safety**: Shared types ensure consistency across packages
- **Deterministic Agent Chain**: Each agent has a specific responsibility and output format
- **Schema Validation**: All inputs and outputs are validated using Zod schemas
- **Event Streaming**: Real-time progress updates during agent processing
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging in CSV format for debugging

### Package Dependencies

```
@business-idea/web ‚Üí @business-idea/shared
@business-idea/core ‚Üí @business-idea/shared
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Persistence

The application now includes a persistence layer using **SQLite and Drizzle ORM**, allowing all generated ideas and agent runs to be saved and retrieved.

### Key Features

- **SQLite Database**: A local `business-ideas.db` file stores all data.
- **Drizzle ORM**: Provides a type-safe query builder for database interactions.
- **Data Repositories**: `RunRepository` and `IdeaRepository` in `packages/core` handle all database operations.
- **API Endpoints**: New routes in `packages/core/src/routes/ideas-routes.ts` expose database content.
- **Frontend Integration**: The `SmartTable` component can now display historical data from the database.

### How to Use

1.  **Database Generation**: The database file is created automatically.
2.  **Migrations**: To generate and apply database migrations, use the following commands in the `packages/core` directory:
    ```bash
    # Generate migration files based on schema changes
    npm run db:generate

    # Apply migrations to the database
    npm run db:migrate
    ```
