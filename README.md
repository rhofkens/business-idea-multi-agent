# Business Idea Generator POC

This project is a Proof of Concept for a multi-agent AI system that generates and evaluates business ideas.

## How It Works

The system operates as a chain of specialized AI agents, orchestrated to perform a sequence of tasks:

1.  **Ideation Agent**: Receives user preferences (e.g., industry, business model) and generates a list of 10 initial business ideas. It scores each idea based on criteria like market potential and technical complexity.
2.  **Competitor Agent**: (To be implemented) Takes the top ideas and performs a competitive analysis.
3.  **Critic Agent**: (To be implemented) Critically evaluates the ideas and the competitive landscape.
4.  **Documentation Agent**: (To be implemented) Generates the final documentation for the validated ideas.
