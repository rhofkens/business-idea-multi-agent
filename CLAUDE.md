# Claude Assistant Preferences

## Git Commit Guidelines

When creating git commits:
- DO NOT include references to Claude, Anthropic, or "Generated with Claude Code"
- DO NOT add Co-Authored-By lines mentioning Claude
- Keep commit messages professional and focused on the changes made
- Use conventional commit format (feat:, fix:, chore:, etc.)
- Focus on what changed and why, not who/what made the changes
