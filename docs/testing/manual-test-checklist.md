# Manual Test Checklist

This checklist guides through manual testing of the business idea multi-agent system.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Node.js 18.x or later installed
- [ ] OpenAI API key set in `.env` file
- [ ] All dependencies installed (`npm install`)

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Basic Execution Test

- [ ] Run `npm start`
- [ ] Verify application starts without errors
- [ ] Confirm "Application starting" log entry is created

Expected output:
- 10 business ideas generated by Ideation Agent
- Blue Ocean scores added by Competitor Agent
- Overall scores calculated by Critic Agent
- Markdown report generated in `docs/output/`

### 2. Test Cache Mode

- [ ] Run `npm start -- --test-cache`
- [ ] Verify "Test cache mode enabled" message appears
- [ ] Confirm agents use cached results from `tests/cache/`
- [ ] Verify execution completes much faster than normal mode

### 3. Agent Chain Validation

  - [ ] Market potential score (1-10)
  - [ ] Technical complexity score (1-10)
  - [ ] Capital intensity score (1-10)
  - [ ] Reasoning object

#### Competitor Agent
- [ ] Processes all 10 ideas from Ideation Agent
- [ ] Adds Blue Ocean score (1-10) to each idea
- [ ] Adds competitor analysis text to each idea
- [ ] Logs first idea's Blue Ocean score

#### Critic Agent
- [ ] Evaluates all 10 ideas from Competitor Agent
- [ ] Adds risk assessment to each idea
- [ ] Adds critical analysis to each idea
- [ ] Calculates overall score using weighted formula
- [ ] Logs first idea's Overall Score

#### Documentation Agent
- [ ] Generates markdown report in `docs/output/`
- [ ] Report filename includes timestamp
- [ ] Report contains:
  - [ ] Introduction section
  - [ ] All 10 business ideas with full details
  - [ ] Summary section with top 3 ideas
- [ ] Logs report path and processing time

### 4. Error Handling

#### Missing API Key
- [ ] Remove/rename `.env` file
- [ ] Run `npm start`
- [ ] Verify error message: "OpenAI API key is missing"
- [ ] Verify application exits with code 1

#### Network Failure
- [ ] Disconnect internet or use invalid API key
- [ ] Run `npm start`
- [ ] Verify appropriate error messages are logged
- [ ] Verify application exits gracefully

### 5. Output Validation

#### Log Files
- [ ] Check `logs/app.csv` exists
- [ ] Verify CSV format with columns: timestamp, level, message, details
- [ ] Confirm logs capture all major operations

#### Markdown Report
- [ ] Open generated report in `docs/output/`
- [ ] Verify markdown formatting is correct
- [ ] Check all sections are present and complete
- [ ] Confirm top 3 ideas are correctly identified by overall score

### 6. Performance Checks

- [ ] Normal execution completes within reasonable time (~2-5 minutes)
- [ ] Test cache mode completes in seconds
- [ ] No memory leaks or hanging processes

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

- [ ] System generates exactly 10 business ideas
- [ ] Ideas align with specified preferences:
  - Vertical: Media & Entertainment
  - Sub-vertical: Digital Media and Content Creation

- [ ] Blue Ocean scores are realistic (1-10 range)
- [ ] Overall scores use correct weighted formula
- [ ] Final markdown report is comprehensive and well-formatted

## Post-Test Cleanup

- [ ] Remove test output files if needed
- [ ] Clear logs for next test run
- [ ] Restore `.env` file if modified
