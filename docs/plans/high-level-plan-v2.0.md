# Business Idea Generator Web Application V2.0 - High-Level Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan focuses on connecting the existing React frontend (created with Lovable) to the backend multi-agent system. The plan is divided into small, testable increments that progressively add real-time functionality to the web application.

## Implementation Increments

| Increment Title | Scope | High-Level Acceptance Criteria | Documentation Tasks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| User Authentication & Session Management | Implement user login with in-memory users, session management infrastructure, and authentication API endpoints | - Users can log in with predefined credentials<br>- Sessions persist across page refreshes<br>- Protected routes redirect to login when unauthorized | - Document authentication API endpoints<br>- Create user authentication guide<br>- Update architecture.md with auth flow |
| Business Preference Integration | Connect business preference form to backend, create API endpoint for triggering idea generation, maintain console output for agents | - Form successfully submits preferences to backend<br>- Backend receives and processes preferences<br>- Agent processing starts and outputs to console | - Document preference submission API<br>- Update API documentation with new endpoint<br>- Create integration testing guide |
| Terminal Output Streaming | Set up WebSocket/SSE infrastructure, connect terminal component to agent events, enable real-time display | - Terminal shows real-time agent output<br>- WebSocket connection handles reconnection<br>- Output streams smoothly without data loss | - Document WebSocket event protocol<br>- Create real-time architecture guide<br>- Update coding guidelines for WebSocket patterns |
| Smart Table - Ideation Agent | Connect ideation agent events to smart table for real-time row population | - New ideas appear in table as generated<br>- Table updates without page refresh<br>- All ideation data fields populate correctly | - Document ideation event structure<br>- Update smart table component docs<br>- Create event mapping guide |
| Smart Table - Competitor Agent | Connect competitor analysis agent to smart table for real-time updates | - Competitor analysis appears in table cells<br>- Blue Ocean scores update in real-time<br>- Preview text shows with ellipsis | - Document competitor event structure<br>- Update API event documentation<br>- Create competitor data flow diagram |
| Smart Table - Critic Agent | Connect business critic agent to smart table for score updates | - Critical analysis appears in table<br>- All score columns update correctly<br>- Overall score calculates after all agents complete | - Document critic event structure<br>- Update scoring methodology docs<br>- Create score calculation guide |
| Smart Table - Documentation Agent | Connect documentation agent for full report generation and viewing | - Full report button activates when ready<br>- Reports open in modal or new view<br>- Markdown renders correctly in UI | - Document report generation events<br>- Update report format specification<br>- Create report viewing guide |
| Agent Workflow Statistics | Connect workflow stats component to event stream for real-time progress | - Progress bars update as agents work<br>- Statistics show accurate agent states<br>- Performance metrics display correctly | - Document statistics event structure<br>- Create monitoring guide<br>- Update architecture with metrics flow |

## Next Steps

After approval of this high-level plan, we will create detailed implementation documents for each increment, specifying:
- Detailed technical scope and tasks
- Specific acceptance criteria and test cases
- Comprehensive documentation requirements
- Technical implementation details
