# Business Idea Generator POC - High-Level Implementation Plan

## Overview

This high-level implementation plan breaks down the Business Idea Generator POC into 5 meaningful increments, each delivering testable value. The plan follows the deterministic multi-agent architecture defined in the project requirements and builds progressively from foundation to complete system.

## Implementation Increments

| Step | Increment Title | Scope | Main Success Criteria |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Foundation & Deterministic Agent Chain** | Set up the basic project structure, dependencies, configuration, and logging. Implement a 4-step deterministic agent chain (Ideation → Competitor → Business Critic → Documentation) where each agent concatenates placeholder output. | The system can be executed without errors and produces a concatenated string of placeholder outputs from the four agents. |
| **2** | **Ideation Agent Implementation** | Develop the agent to generate 10 business ideas with initial 4-dimensional scoring (disruption, market, technical, capital). | The system runs error-free, and the Ideation Agent produces 10 distinct, well-defined business ideas with all required scoring dimensions and reasoning. |
| **3** | **Competitor Analysis Agent** | Implement the agent to perform market research using web search and calculate Blue Ocean scores. | The system runs error-free, and the Competitor Analysis Agent enriches each business idea with competitor data and a valid Blue Ocean score. |
| **4** | **Business Critic Agent** | Develop the agent for critical evaluation, risk assessment, and overall scoring. | The system runs error-free, and the Business Critic Agent adds a balanced critical analysis and a final overall score to each business idea. |
| **5** | **Documentation & End-to-End Validation** | Implement the final agent to generate a structured markdown report. Perform end-to-end integration, error handling, and validation. | The system runs error-free, producing a complete, well-formatted markdown report that accurately reflects the analysis from all preceding agents. |

## Success Metrics

- **Functional Success**: All 7 increments deliver their specified scope and meet acceptance criteria
- **Quality Success**: Each increment adds measurable value and maintains system integrity
- **Technical Success**: Progressive build-up ensures stable foundation for subsequent increments
- **Documentation Success**: Clear documentation enables effective handoff to implementation teams

## Dependencies

- All increments build sequentially on previous increments
- Increments 4 and 5 both depend on web search functionality
- Increment 6 depends on complete data model from all previous agents
- Increment 7 requires all previous increments to be fully functional
