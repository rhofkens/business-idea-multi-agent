# Detailed Plan: Documentation & End-to-End Validation

This document provides the detailed implementation plan for the fifth and final increment: developing the Documentation Agent and performing end-to-end system validation.

## 1. Detailed Scope

### Agent Logic & Output
- **Full Implementation**: Replace the placeholder `documentation-agent.ts` with the full agent logic.
- **Detailed Prompting**: Develop a detailed prompt that instructs the agent to take the final, fully-analyzed array of business ideas and format it into a structured, professional Markdown report.
- **Report Content**: The generated report must include:
    - A main title and introduction.
    - A separate, well-formatted table for each of the 10 business ideas, presenting all collected data clearly.
    - A summary section that highlights the top 3 business ideas based on their `overallScore`.
    - A metadata section that includes processing statistics (e.g., total execution time).

### End-to-End Integration & Validation
- **Orchestrator Integration**: The `AgentOrchestrator` will pass the final, fully-analyzed data array to the Documentation Agent.
- **File Output**: The Documentation Agent will save the generated report as a `.md` file in the `docs/output` directory, with a filename that includes a timestamp (e.g., `business-idea-report-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md`).
- **System Validation**: Perform a full, end-to-end run of the entire system. This run must complete without any errors, from the initial CLI command to the final report generation.

### Out of Scope for this Increment
- No new features or agent capabilities will be added.
- No further changes to the Ideation, Competitor, or Critic agents. The focus is strictly on output generation and final system validation.

## 2. Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Correctness
- **Data Reception**: The Documentation Agent correctly receives the final, fully-analyzed data array from the Business Critic Agent without any data loss or corruption.
- **File Creation**: A new Markdown file is successfully created in the `docs/output` directory with a timestamp-based filename.

### Output Validation
- **Formatting**: The generated Markdown report is well-formatted, with proper use of headings, tables, and lists, ensuring it is human-readable.
- **Content Accuracy**: The report contains a distinct section for each of the 10 business ideas, and all data fields (scores, analysis, etc.) are present and correctly formatted within the tables.
- **"Top 3" Summary**: The report includes a "Top 3" summary section that accurately identifies and lists the three business ideas with the highest `overallScore`.
- **Metadata**: The report contains a metadata section that includes relevant processing statistics, such as total execution time.

### End-to-End System Validation
- **Error-Free Execution**: A single, complete execution of the `main.ts` script runs the entire four-agent chain from start to finish without throwing any unhandled exceptions or crashing.
- **Data Flow Integrity**: The final output report is a true and accurate reflection of the data transformations and enrichments performed by all preceding agents in the chain.

## 3. Detailed Documentation Tasks

- **JSDoc Comments**: Add comprehensive JSDoc comments to the new `documentation-agent.ts` file, explaining its purpose, its parameters, and how it generates the final report.
- **README.md Finalization**: Finalize the main project `README.md` by:
    - Completing the "Installation" section with final, verified steps.
    - Completing the "Usage" section with instructions on how to run the application.
    - Adding a new section that describes the final Markdown report output, explaining its structure and content.
