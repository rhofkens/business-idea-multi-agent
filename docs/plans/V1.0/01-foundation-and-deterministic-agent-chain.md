# Detailed Plan: Foundation & Deterministic Agent Chain

This document provides the detailed implementation plan for the first increment: setting up the project foundation and a deterministic agent chain.

## 1. Detailed Scope

### Project Setup & Structure
- **Project Initialization**: Initialize a new Node.js project using `npm init`.
- **Dependency Installation**: Install all core dependencies as specified in the `architecture.md`, including TypeScript, the OpenAI Agents SDK, and any other required packages.
- **Folder Structure**: Create the complete folder structure as defined in `architecture.md`, including directories for `src`, `agents`, `orchestrator`, `services`, `types`, `utils`, and `docs`.
- **Configuration**:
    - `tsconfig.json`: Configure for strict type checking to ensure code quality.
    - `eslint.config.js`: Set up ESLint based on the project's coding guidelines to enforce consistent code style.

### Core Services
- **Logging Service**: Implement a basic CSV logging service (`logging-service.ts`) that writes logs to a file in the format specified in `architecture.md`.
- **Configuration Service**: Implement a configuration service (`config-service.ts`) to manage environment variables, particularly for the OpenAI API key.
- **Type Definitions**: Define all core TypeScript data structures in the `types` directory (e.g., `BusinessIdea`, `BusinessPreferences`). Ensure all types are documented with JSDoc comments as per the `coding-guidelines.md`.

### Agent Chain Implementation
- **Basic Agent Implementations**: Create basic implementations for all four agents. Each agent will be initialized with a very simple prompt (e.g., "You are the Ideation Agent. Acknowledge this and wait for the next instruction.").
- **Agent Orchestrator**: Implement the `AgentOrchestrator` to call these basic agents sequentially, passing a simple message between them to verify the chain is connected.
- **CLI Entry Point**: Create a `main.ts` file to execute the orchestrator and print the final output to the console.

### Out of Scope for this Increment
- Complex, multi-step prompting for agents.
- No integration with the `web_search` tool.
- No automated tests; manual execution is sufficient for this increment.

## 2. Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Project Setup & Structure
- The command `npm install` completes without errors for all required dependencies.
- All specified folders (`src`, `agents`, `orchestrator`, etc.) are present in the project root.
- The command `npx tsc --noEmit` runs successfully, indicating a valid TypeScript configuration with no compilation errors.
- The command `npx eslint .` runs without reporting any linting errors, confirming adherence to coding standards.

### Core Services
- Invoking the logging service correctly creates a `.csv` log file with the specified headers (`"timestamp","level","message","agent","details"`) and a sample log entry.
- The configuration service successfully loads the `OPENAI_API_KEY` from a `.env` file when called.
- All TypeScript types defined in the `types` directory pass compilation and linting checks.

### Agent Chain Execution & End-to-End Verification
- Executing the application via `node dist/main.js` runs from start to finish without any runtime errors.
- The `OPENAI_API_KEY` is successfully used to make at least one call to the OpenAI API.
- The console output displays a final message that is the result of the four agents being called in sequence, demonstrating a successful end-to-end data flow (e.g., "Ideation acknowledged -> Competitor acknowledged -> Critic acknowledged -> Documentation complete").
- The process exits cleanly with code 0.

## 3. Detailed Documentation Tasks

- **README.md Creation**: Create a basic `README.md` file at the project root. It should include the project title and a brief description, with placeholder sections for "Installation" and "Usage" to be filled out in later increments.
