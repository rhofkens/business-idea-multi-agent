## Market Analysis

Volumetric capture market $1.8B (2024), projected $15B by 2030 (65% CAGR). Compression is the bottleneck; solving it unlocks mass adoption. Targeting 15% market share implies $2.3B ARR potential as metaverse scales.

## Technical Requirements

- Neural radiance field (NeRF) compression to 2Mbps streams
- Real-time encoding/decoding on edge devices (RTX 4060+)
- Temporal coherence optimization for smooth playback
- WebRTC integration for low-latency streaming
- SDKs for Unity, Unreal, and native platforms

## Competitive Landscape

Key competitors include 8i (shut down), Arcturus, Evercoast, Intel Studios, Dimension Studio, and Volucap. Only VoluPress achieves 98% compression via neural radiance fields, real-time encode/decode on consumer GPUs, streaming over standard 5G connections, temporal coherence for smooth motion, and platform-agnostic codec design.

## Financial Projections

- Initial investment: $45M
- Break-even: 30 months at $0.10/GB compressed and 500PB monthly volume
- 10Ã—: License to smartphone manufacturers for built-in holographic calling

## Risk Assessment

- Technical complexity of real-time NeRF compression
- Hardware requirements limiting early adoption
- Standards fragmentation in volumetric video
- Competition from tech giants (Google, Apple)
- Market timing risk if metaverse adoption slows
- Patent landscape around neural compression techniques
