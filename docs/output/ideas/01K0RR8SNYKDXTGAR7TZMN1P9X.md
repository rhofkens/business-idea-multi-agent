## Key Metrics

- **Disruption Potential**: 5/10
- **Market Potential**: 7/10
- **Technical Complexity**: 6/10
- **Capital Intensity**: 7/10
- **Blue Ocean Score**: 7/10
- **Overall Score**: 5.5/10

## Market Analysis

$70B licensing sector growing 8% CAGR; user-generated content (UGC) economy expected to hit $250B by 2027. Capturing 0.5% of UGC transactions implies $1.25B GPV, $62M revenue at 5% take rate.

## Technical Requirements

- Polygon zkEVM for $0.0004 gas/tx
- Content-ID-style perceptual hashing
- EIP-2981 royalty standards support
- EU DSA & US CASE Act compliance
- OFAC screening APIs integration

## Competitive Landscape

Major competitors include Digimarc, KodakOne, Pex Attribution Engine, Mozaic, and Royal.io. No current platform combines invisible watermarks, L2 smart contracts for sub-$0.01 gas, and 200ms SDK for any UGC app.

## Financial Projections

- Initial investment: $70M
- 5-year payback contingent on 100M monthly licensed impressions
- Optional 10Ã—: Bundle with AI detection to flag unlicensed AI-generated art

## Risk Assessment

- Watermark robustness challenges with AI removal
- Adoption bottleneck requiring platform integration
- Regulatory compliance overhead (EU DSA, OFAC)
- Technical SLA risks for 200ms clearance
- Patent and competitive pressure from Digimarc
- Capital runway concerns
