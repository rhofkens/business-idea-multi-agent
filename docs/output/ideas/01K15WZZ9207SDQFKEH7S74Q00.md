## NanoGridSim – Microgrid Planning & Monetization Platform

### Executive Summary
NanoGridSim is a cloud-based simulator that combines physics-based distributed energy resource (DER) models, ISO day-ahead prices, and electric-vehicle (EV) telematics to optimise PV-storage sizing and forecast revenue from front-of-the-meter (FTM) and behind-the-meter (BTM) energy trading. The platform outputs bankable pro-formas and auto-generates interconnection paperwork, with an optional control-firmware subscription to execute the strategies post-build.

Offered through a freemium design tool (up to 250 kW) that converts to a US $12 k annual licence for sites larger than 1 MW, NanoGridSim layers a recurring 0.5 ¢/kWh SaaS fee on live dispatch via its embedded firmware. Strong market (8/10) and technical (8/10) scores underscore its ability to address a rapidly expanding global microgrid sector while disrupting (7/10) fragmented consultant workflows by providing a single digital-twin pipeline from design through operations.

### Scoring Analysis
- Market Potential: 8/10  
- Disruption Potential: 7/10  
- Technical Complexity: 8/10  
- Capital Intensity: 6/10  
- Blue Ocean Score: 5.5/10  
- Overall Score: 5.7/10  

### Strategic Reasoning

#### Market Potential
Global microgrid capacity expected to hit 29 GW by 2028; capturing modelling for 3 % of new installs equals \$150 M ARR potential.

#### Disruption Potential
Bridges gap between design and operational monetisation, replacing two separate consultant workflows with a single digital twin pipeline.

#### Technical Complexity
Need certified grid-interconnection algorithms and high-resolution EV load forecasts; leveraging openFIDO standards and co-simulation with OpenDSS reduces dev time.

#### Capital Requirements
Initial \$10 M seed for engine and UL certification; breakeven in Yr 4 if 400 paid licences secured—avoids prior \$50 M heavy spend by integrating open-source solvers.

#### Blue Ocean Strategy
Competitor Score: 4/10, Saturation Score: 5/10, Innovation Score: 8/10. Calculation: (0.4 × 4) + (0.3 × 5) + (0.3 × 8) = 1.6 + 1.5 + 2.4 = 5.5

### Competitive Landscape
1. Direct design-simulation competitors:  
   • HOMER Pro/Grid/Front by UL Solutions is the incumbent techno-economic simulator for microgrids but stops at design hand-off and does not automate interconnection packets or live dispatch. (ul-renewables.com)  
   • Xendee DESIGN/PROPOSE provides bankable pro-formas, EV fast-charge modules and a forthcoming operations layer; pricing starts at \$175/user/mo, indicating a similar up-market SaaS positioning. (solarbuildermag.com)

2. Design-to-control full-stack platforms:  
   • Energy Toolbase (ETB Developer → ETB Controller → ETB Monitor) links modelling with storage dispatch and measurement & verification; it levies per-site controller fees rather than a volumetric ¢/kWh tariff. (energytoolbase.com)  
   • Typhoon HIL offers high-fidelity HIL digital-twin simulation but is hardware-centric and geared toward R&D labs rather than bankable project finance modelling. (typhoon-hil.com)

3. Controllers/Firmware (optional module overlap):  
   • Heila EDGE and PXiSE microgrid controllers optimise DER dispatch and can participate in markets, competing with NanoGridSim’s firmware add-on but lacking the upstream sizing/pro-forma tools. (heilatech.com, pxise.com)

4. Workflow-automation point solutions:  
   • GridUnity GridSync/GridInterConnect digitises interconnection study paperwork for TOs and utilities; NanoGridSim folds a lighter version of this feature directly into the design flow. (gridunity.com)

5. Market structure:  
   The microgrid software/services market is growing fast (20 % CAGR to \$79 B by 2028) but remains fragmented across planning, paperwork and operations silos. (prnewswire.com, businesswire.com)

6. White-space advantages for NanoGridSim:  
   • Single code-base covering planning → revenue forecasting → auto-generated interconnection forms → optional embedded dispatch firmware.  
   • Usage-based 0.5 ¢/kWh fee aligns with energy arbitrage revenue and creates a lower barrier than per-site controller licences.  
   • Physics-based EV telematics gives superior load forecasts vs. statistical profiles used by most incumbents.  
   Overall, while several credible competitors exist, none yet deliver the full “design-to-cash-flow” stack in one SaaS, leaving room for blue-ocean positioning.

### Business Model
Freemium design tool (up to 250 kW) converts to a \$12 k annual licence for sites exceeding 1 MW; a 0.5 ¢/kWh SaaS fee on live dispatch via embedded firmware provides recurring upside.

### Investment Highlights
• Strongest aspects: Market Potential 8/10 and Technical Complexity 8/10 indicate significant demand and robust technical differentiation.  
• Key opportunities: Addressing 3 % of projected 29 GW global microgrid installs translates to \$150 M ARR potential; leveraging open-source solvers lowers required capital.  
• Strategic advantages: Single digital-twin workflow from design through operations, usage-based pricing, and physics-based EV load forecasting collectively support disruptive positioning and recurring revenue growth.
