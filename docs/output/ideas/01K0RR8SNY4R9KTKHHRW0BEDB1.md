# HoloZip Compression Cloud

## Executive Summary

HoloZip offers a neural tensor codec that compresses holographic and light-field assets by 92% (from 1 Gbps to 80 Mbps) while maintaining <2% PSNR drop. Delivered via WebAssembly and Vulkan decoders, the service lets telecoms stream full-parallax AR concerts over 5G and Wi-Fi 6 without edge boxes.

## Key Metrics

- **Disruption Potential**: 8/10
- **Market Potential**: 5/10
- **Technical Complexity**: 9/10
- **Capital Intensity**: 6/10
- **Blue Ocean Score**: 6.9/10
- **Overall Score**: 5.3/10

## Market Analysis

AR/VR content tools $8B (25% CAGR). If Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest 4 hit 40M cumulative units by 2028, codec licensing could reach $400M ARR at $0.02/GB fees. Telco CDN licensing adds upside but long sales cycles.

## Technical Requirements

- 3D autoencoders with vector quantization trained on 25 PB synthetic light-field data
- GPU inference optimized by TensorRT
- Per-tile temporal residuals for progressive decode at 60 fps on mobile NPUs
- WebAssembly and Vulkan decoder implementation

## Competitive Landscape

Key competitors include Arcturus HoloSuite, Google Project Starline, MPEG-I standards, and various academic/OSS neural codecs. No dominant neural-tensor codec provider exists yet. Incumbents focus on capture workflows rather than cloud GPU inference.

## Financial Projections

- Initial investment: $75M
- Break-even: Year 4 unless enterprise AR picks up faster
- Potential pivot: License codec IP to Qualcomm/NVIDIA for SoC integration

## Risk Assessment

- Market timing with small XR installed base
- Technical hurdles with device-side decode
- Network bandwidth constraints in real-world conditions
- Regulatory compliance for volumetric data
- GPU cost structure challenges
- Standards commoditization threat
