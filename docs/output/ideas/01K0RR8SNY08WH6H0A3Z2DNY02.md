# RenderMesh Distributed GPU Orchestrator

## Executive Summary

RenderMesh aggregates idle GPUs from gamers/miners into a render farm via P2P orchestration. Studios submit Blender/Maya jobs; RenderMesh splits frames across 10,000 nodes, renders in parallel, and reassembles output 70% cheaper than AWS. Redundant encoding ensures 99.9% uptime despite node churn.

## Key Metrics

- **Disruption Potential**: 8/10
- **Market Potential**: 9/10
- **Technical Complexity**: 9/10
- **Capital Intensity**: 6/10
- **Blue Ocean Score**: 8.4/10
- **Overall Score**: 8.08/10

## Market Analysis

Cloud rendering market $3.5B, growing 25% CAGR to $11B by 2028. Securing 12% share implies $1.3B ARR. Pixar/ILM spend $50M/year on render farms; indies can't afford it. Democratizing access unlocks massive latent demand.

## Technical Requirements

- WebRTC-based P2P mesh for job distribution
- CUDA/OpenCL abstraction layer for heterogeneous GPUs
- Merkle tree verification for rendered frame integrity
- Kubernetes-style orchestrator with spot pricing
- Plugin support for major 3D software suites

## Competitive Landscape

Key competitors include Render Token (RNDR), SheepIt, Golem Network, AWS Thinkbox Deadline, Google Zync, and Microsoft Azure Batch. Only RenderMesh offers native integration with Blender/Maya/C4D plugins, sub-minute job startup via hot GPU pools, redundant rendering with Byzantine fault tolerance, spot pricing 70% below AWS rates, and automatic scene optimization for distributed rendering.

## Financial Projections

- Initial investment: $28M
- Break-even: 22 months at $0.02/GPU-hour margin and 50M hours/month
- 10Ã—: Expand to AI training workloads and real-time ray tracing for games

## Risk Assessment

- Node reliability and quality consistency challenges
- Network bandwidth bottlenecks for large scenes
- Security concerns with proprietary assets
- Competition from established cloud providers
- Cryptocurrency market volatility affecting GPU availability
- Legal liability for rendered content
