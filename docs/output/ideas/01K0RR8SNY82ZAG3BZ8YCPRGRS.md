# EmotionTracks Scoring AI

## Executive Summary

EmotionTracks ingests raw dialogue, reads bio-sensors (GSR, pulse), and predicts emotional arcs for a scene. Composers get MIDI/tempo/chord suggestions that match arcs; editors receive cue-point flags. Netflix, EA, and A24 want mood-adaptive scores that heighten immersion and reduce post-production time by 30%.

## Key Metrics

- **Disruption Potential**: 8/10
- **Market Potential**: 9/10
- **Technical Complexity**: 7/10
- **Capital Intensity**: 5/10
- **Blue Ocean Score**: 8.1/10
- **Overall Score**: 7.42/10

## Market Analysis

Film/TV scoring market $7B, video game music $5B, streaming content scoring $4B—total $16B. Disrupting 8% implies $1.3B ARR. AI-assisted scoring raises productivity, unblocking bottlenecks in trailer/episodic content.

## Technical Requirements

- Bi-modal transformer analyzing text+biometrics for emotion mapping
- MIDI generation via diffusion networks constrained to mood arcs
- Real-time feedback loop for editors using SMPTE timecode
- DAW plugin integration for ProTools/Logic/Cubase

## Competitive Landscape

Key competitors include Amper Music (acquired by Shutterstock), Filmstro, AIVA, Scored.audio, Ecrett Music, and Boomy. Only EmotionTracks integrates biometric feedback during scene capture, generates adaptive MIDI arcs for manual fine-tuning, syncs cue points to emotional peaks in dialogue, and provides real-time preview for editors/directors.

## Financial Projections

- Initial investment: $18M
- Break-even: 16 months at $3,000/month per studio seat and 1,800 seats sold
- 10×: License emotion models to AR/VR platforms for reactive soundscapes

## Risk Assessment

- Creative resistance and composer unions pushback
- Quality/originality concerns without manual curation
- Complexity of integrating with existing workflows
- Legal uncertainty on AI-generated music rights
- Competitive pressure from Shutterstock/AIVA
- Biometric data privacy compliance challenges
