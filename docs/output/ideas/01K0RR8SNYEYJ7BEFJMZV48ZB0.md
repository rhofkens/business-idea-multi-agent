## Market Analysis

Voice-over/dubbing $20B, conversational AI voices $15B, gaming voice assets $9B—total $44B. Securing 3% share implies $1.3B ARR potential. Regulatory tailwind: EU AI Act forces traceability, advantaging watermarked solutions.

## Technical Requirements

- Diffusion-based TTS models (60-kHz, 48-k token context) fine-tuned per speaker
- On-the-fly watermark via spread-spectrum phase modulation
- Consent ledger on Hyperledger Fabric for auditability
- SAG-AFTRA compliance framework

## Competitive Landscape

Key competitors include Veritone Voice, Respeecher, Replica Studios, Ethovox, ElevenLabs, and Altered AI. Only VocalVault combines sub-120ms streaming, per-utterance cryptographic watermarking every 250ms, voiceprint capture in confidential-compute enclave, and built-in union-compliant licensing.

## Financial Projections

- Initial investment: $38M
- Break-even: 24 months at $0.0006/char pricing and 150M chars/day utilization
- 10×: Bundle with lip-sync video generation for full-body synthetic performances

## Risk Assessment

- Watermark robustness and removal attacks
- Latency vs. security trade-offs with GPU TEEs
- Regulatory flux with EU AI Act
- Market adoption and fan reception concerns
- Competitive pressure from ElevenLabs
- Legal uncertainty on watermark evidentiary value
