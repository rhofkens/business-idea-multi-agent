# CloudFlux Virtual Production Suite

## Executive Summary

CloudFlux is a browser-based virtual production hub that fuses custom diffusion models, Unreal Engine 5.4, and 40-ms round-trip cloud rendering to generate photoreal sets, characters, and lighting on demand. A single art director can spin up a 10K-polygon New York backlot in 30 seconds and share a live USD scene to any stakeholder worldwide.

## Key Metrics

- **Disruption Potential**: 8/10
- **Market Potential**: 7/10
- **Technical Complexity**: 9/10
- **Capital Intensity**: 8/10
- **Blue Ocean Score**: 6.6/10
- **Overall Score**: 5.4/10

## Market Analysis

Streaming originals will drive production services spend from $50B today to $85B by 2030 (Ampere Analysis). Capturing 2% of that spend gives a $1.7B ARR ceiling. Near-term wedge: 4,200 mid-tier studios and virtual stage facilities that cannot justify in-house LED volumes.

## Technical Requirements

- 3,000+ A100/H100 GPUs for low-latency raytracing
- Proprietary asset-gen diffusion model fine-tuned on 150 TB of photogrammetry data
- Bi-directional USD/HLSL bridges for game-engine interoperability
- Edge POPs in LA, London, and Seoul keep latency <40 ms

## Competitive Landscape

Major competitors include Disguise Porta + RenderStream, NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud, and AWS Nimble Studio (now retired). No incumbent yet combines sub-40 ms GPU streaming, custom diffusion models for 3D asset spawning, and real-time USD scene sharing in a browser.

## Financial Projections

- Initial investment: ~$180M over five years
- Break-even: Year 5 at 28% gross margin
- Potential 10Ã— upside by spinning off the asset marketplace

## Risk Assessment

- Execution risk based on prior cloud-VFX platform failures
- Latency challenges in achieving global 40ms target
- GPU cost and supply constraints
- Legal and union pushback on AI-generated assets
- Security compliance requirements (TPN v5.2)
