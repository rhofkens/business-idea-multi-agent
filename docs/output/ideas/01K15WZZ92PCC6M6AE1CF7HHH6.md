## PermiFast AI – Instant Building Permit Automation

### Executive Summary
PermiFast AI delivers a vertical-focused generative AI platform that ingests municipal zoning, fire, and energy codes to automatically create code-compliant BIM layers and narrative sheets directly inside Revit or Archicad. Real-time clash and ordinance alerts reduce resubmittals by 70 % and compress average approval times from 120 days to fewer than 10. A city-facing dashboard presents explainable AI rulings, accelerating reviewer sign-off while providing an auditable liability trail.

The usage-based SaaS model—$500 per active project plus $0.02 per m² processed—targets architecture/engineering firms, while enterprise seats for municipalities (ARR $150 k per city) and premium API licensing for design-tool vendors expand revenue streams. Strong Market Potential (8/10) is underpinned by an initial $3.5 B North American permitting TAM that could grow to $12 B worldwide by 2030. Disruption Potential (7/10) stems from automating a legally binding workflow that consumes 15–20 % of design hours, positioning the first mover to become the de-facto digital code standard.

### Scoring Analysis
- Market Potential: 8/10  
- Disruption Potential: 7/10  
- Technical Complexity: 7/10  
- Capital Intensity: 6/10  
- Blue Ocean Score: 6.6/10  
- Overall Score: 6.1/10  

### Strategic Reasoning

#### Market Potential
Initial TAM: $3.5 B in North-American permitting fees; expansion to 30,000+ municipalities worldwide lifts TAM to $12 B by 2030 under 11 % CAGR digital-permits trend.

#### Disruption Potential
Automates a multi-party, legally binding workflow that today absorbs 15-20 % of total design hours; first mover can become de-facto digital code standard.

#### Technical Complexity
Requires continual fine-tuning of LLMs on >8 M public ordinances, a computer-vision layer for drawing validation, and secure GovCloud deployment; MVP achievable in 9 months with $6 M.

#### Capital Requirements
Total $45 M Series A-C for ordinance licensing, sales to authorities, and SOC-2 / FedRAMP compliance; break-even projected in year 4 at 3 % US municipal penetration. Hidden risk: slow-moving city procurement—mitigate via revenue-share pilots.

#### Blue Ocean Strategy
Competitor Score: 6/10, Saturation Score: 6/10, Innovation Score: 8/10.  
Calculation: (0.4 × 6) + (0.3 × 6) + (0.3 × 8) = 2.4 + 1.8 + 2.4 = 6.6

### Competitive Landscape
1. **UpCodes** – Real-time code “spell-check” inside Revit and Chat-style Q&A across 4,800+ U.S. codes. Well adopted by design firms but does not generate BIM layers or submit to cities.  
2. **PermitFlow** – YC-backed SaaS that pre-fills forms, tracks status and employs expediters for contractors. Focus is paperwork automation, not model-based compliance or municipal AI dashboards. Raised $31 M (Feb 2024) to expand across CA/TX/FL.  
3. **Symbium** – Web portal that lets property owners run instant zoning/energy checks and pull certain permits (ADUs, solar) in seconds. Limited to prescriptive residential use cases and a handful of states.  
4. **Accela + ePermitHub** – Leading government e-permit platform (2,000+ agencies). April 2025 acquisition adds AI-driven plan-review automation; still file-centric PDF workflows with no deep BIM reasoning.  
5. **Verifi3D by Xinaps** – Cloud rule-engine that checks IFC/Revit models against EU building codes and is piloted in the CHEK digital-permit project. Geared to consultants rather than permitting authorities; lacks generative layer creation.  
6. **Autodesk Model Checker & open-source tools (Speckle, PlanChecker)** – Free rule-based validators widely used for QA but require users to script rules and do not ingest live municipal ordinances or return legal rationales.  

Market context: Global construction & design software is projected to grow at a 10.4 % CAGR to $19.1 B by 2030; permit-management software alone is a smaller but faster-growing $350 M → $980 M niche (10.8 % CAGR). This indicates an expanding, yet still unsaturated, opportunity for AI-native solutions aimed at municipalities.

### Business Model
Usage-based SaaS: $500 per active project plus $0.02 per m² processed, supplemented by enterprise municipal seats (ARR $150 k per city) and premium API licensing for design-tool vendors. The dual-sided go-to-market strategy (A/E firms and municipalities) is designed to build network effects.

### Investment Highlights
• Highest score: Market Potential (8/10) reflects a sizeable and growing TAM from $3.5 B to $12 B by 2030.  
• Key opportunity: Automating 15–20 % of design hours and reducing approval times from 120 days to <10 offers tangible ROI for both private firms and municipalities.  
• Strategic advantages:  
  – Generative layer creation and real-time clash/ordinance alerts differentiate PermiFast AI from rule-checking incumbents.  
  – Explainable AI dashboard provides municipalities with an auditable liability shield, enhancing adoption prospects.  
  – Moderate Capital Intensity (6/10) with an MVP achievable in 9 months and break-even at 3 % U.S. municipal penetration supports a capital-efficient growth trajectory.
