## Market Analysis

XR advertising $4B (2024), growing 45% CAGR to $25B by 2027. Securing 8% share implies $2B ARR. Apple Vision Pro/Meta Quest 3 adoption inflection point approaching, with 50M headsets projected by 2026.

## Technical Requirements

- Real-time scene understanding via depth maps and semantic segmentation
- Physics-aware placement to avoid breaking immersion
- Eye-tracking integration for viewability metrics (WebXR API)
- Edge compute for sub-10ms ad insertion latency

## Competitive Landscape

Key competitors include Admix (acquired by In-Play), Adverty, Bidstack, Anzu.io, Yahoo Immersive, and Unity Ads. Only XRAdSync provides physics-aware occlusion handling in real-time, eye-tracking heatmap optimization for placement, SDK-free integration via WebXR standards, and cross-platform support (Quest/Vision Pro/Pico).
