## ResilientIQ – Climate-Adaptive Design Scoring Engine

### Executive Summary
ResilientIQ is an AI-driven, climate-adaptive design scoring engine that automatically evaluates BIM files against down-scaled CMIP6 climate projections, geospatial hazard layers, and a 50,000-material durability database. The platform scores flood, heat, and wind resilience and then value-engineers the lowest-cost, code-compliant adaptations while producing payback and IRR metrics. An MVP is slated for launch within 18 months and will pursue LEED/EDGE certifiers and property insurers as primary channel partners.

Operating as a tiered SaaS model with per-project and API pricing ($5k–$50k ACV) plus white-label licensing for insurers and lending consortia, ResilientIQ targets a market where regulators now mandate physical-risk disclosure for US $80 trillion in real-estate assets. The solution’s high Market Potential (8/10) and Disruption Potential (8/10) scores underscore its capacity to replace costly consultancy fees and to become integral to climate-linked financing. Balanced Technical Complexity (8/10) and moderate Capital Intensity (6/10) indicate feasibility, while a Blue Ocean Score of 7/10 highlights meaningful differentiation in a still-emerging competitive field.

### Scoring Analysis
- Market Potential: 8/10  
- Disruption Potential: 8/10  
- Technical Complexity: 8/10  
- Capital Intensity: 6/10  
- Blue Ocean Score: 7/10  
- Overall Score: 6.3/10  

### Strategic Reasoning

#### Market Potential
Regulators now require physical-risk disclosure for US $80 trillion of real-estate assets; even 1 % market capture equals US $800 million ARR.

#### Disruption Potential
Instant, algorithmic risk scoring will cut ~US $25 k per-project consultancy fees and become a prerequisite for climate-linked loans within 3 years.

#### Technical Complexity
Primary hurdles are licensing 1-m resolution elevation data globally and validating degradation models; cloud-native GPU inference and graph databases mitigate scale bottlenecks.

#### Capital Requirements
Seed US $8 million for data rights plus 12 FTEs; Series A US $22 million for global hazard mapping; positive cash-flow by Year 4—lower than earlier US $45 million estimate.

#### Blue Ocean Strategy
Competitor Score: 7/10  
Saturation Score: 6/10  
Innovation Score: 8/10  
Calculation: (0.4 × 7) + (0.3 × 6) + (0.3 × 8) = 7.0

### Competitive Landscape
1. Physical-risk analytics platforms  
   • Jupiter Intelligence – asset-level hazard scores and ROI of generic measures; no BIM ingestion or material-level optimization.  
   • Moody’s RMS Climate on Demand – location-based hazard and loss metrics; lacks design-phase BIM integration.  
   • Cervest EarthScan – portfolio-wide climate-value-at-risk ratings; leaves engineers to devise adaptations.  
   • First Street Foundation – parcel-level peril scores focused on disclosure, not design specification.

2. Digital-twin resilience players  
   • One Concern Domino – models cascading outages and downtime costs; does not read BIM or select cheapest code-compliant retrofits.

3. BIM-adjacent sustainability tools  
   • bimCAT/Tally, EC3, Vectorworks Energos, Pollination – quantify embodied carbon or energy; none connect to CMIP6 hazard layers or durability database.  
   • WeatherShift – provides future weather files that require manual interpretation.

4. Consulting toolkits  
   • AIA Resilience Design Toolkit, ULI Risk Reduction Matrix – manual spreadsheets and PDFs, illustrating demand but not automated SaaS competitors.

Market size & growth: The global climate-risk analytics market is projected to reach US $66.8 billion by 2032 (CAGR ≈ 6.5 %). S&P Global estimates physical climate risks could cost the S&P 1200 companies US $1.2 trillion per year by the 2050s.

Competitive gaps addressed by ResilientIQ:  
(a) automatic BIM/IFC ingestion,  
(b) peril-specific material degradation curves linked to adaptation cost/IRR,  
(c) generation of prescriptive, code-aligned retrofit packages.

### Business Model
Tiered SaaS (per-project and API calls) with annual contract values of US $5 k–US $50 k. White-label licensing to insurers and lending consortia introduces a data-analytics revenue-share component.

### Investment Highlights
• Strongest aspects:  
  – High Market Potential (8/10) driven by mandatory risk disclosure across US $80 trillion in assets.  
  – High Disruption Potential (8/10) from eliminating ~US $25 k consultancy fees per project and aligning with climate-linked lending requirements.  

• Key opportunities:  
  – Even 1 % market share equates to US $800 million ARR.  
  – Positive cash-flow projected by Year 4 with lower capital requirements than prior estimates.  

• Notable strategic advantages:  
  – Unique end-to-end workflow: BIM ingestion, hazard assessment, material-level adaptation optimization, and financial metrics.  
  – Differentiated position highlighted by a 7/10 Blue Ocean Score and clear gaps in incumbent offerings.
